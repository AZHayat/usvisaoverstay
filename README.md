# 🌍 US Visa Overstay Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing US visa overstays using a dataset that includes data from 195 countries. The goal is to explore yearly overstay trends, compare the highest and lowest overstay rates by country, examine changes during the pandemic, and predict future overstays.

## 🗂 Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains visa overstay data from 2015 to 2022, with the following columns:

COUNTRY: The name of the country.
2015: Overstay rates for the year 2015.
2016: Overstay rates for the year 2016.
2017: Overstay rates for the year 2017.
2018: Overstay rates for the year 2018.
2019: Overstay rates for the year 2019.
2020: Overstay rates for the year 2020.
2021: Overstay rates for the year 2021.
2022: Overstay rates for the year 2022.


## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
For this project, the following tools and libraries were used:

Python: For data manipulation and analysis.
Pandas: To clean and preprocess the data.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Statsmodels: For implementing ARIMA for time series forecasting.
Scikit-learn: For linear regression modeling.
Jupyter Notebook: As the development environment.


## 📈 Key Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The core focus of this analysis is to conduct an exploratory data analysis on US visa overstays:

Yearly Overstay Trends: Analyze how overstay rates have changed year over year.
Highest vs. Lowest Overstay Rates: Identify countries with the highest and lowest overstay rates in the dataset.
Pandemic Overstay Changes: Examine how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted overstay rates.
Future Predictions: Utilize historical data to predict future trends in overstays.


## 🔍 Key Findings
Yearly Trends: Overstay rates exhibited significant fluctuations during the pandemic.
Country Comparisons: Some countries consistently show high overstay rates, indicating potential areas for policy focus.
Future Predictions: Based on historical trends, certain patterns may indicate future increases or decreases in overstays.
